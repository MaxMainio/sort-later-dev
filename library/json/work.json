This collection was annotated in analog and further narrowed down to form a narrative surrounding my object- on the subjectivity of humor as well as the different modes of humor in reference to a banana (referential, slapstick, freudian, etc.) This analysis is mapped onto a poster (24x36), which also folds into a papercraft banana.\n\nThe next step was making public works of our collections, so I looked to create a community bonding event in which the public collaborated to make one very large banana made of chipboard. This event spread joy and emphasized the lightheartedness and hilarity of BananaCulture."

I also combined symbols to form a vagina out of type ({!}).\n\nWhile working on this project, Texas enacted a controversial law banning most abortions. In response to this political development, I shifted the main phrase to “Family Values”, parodying the conservative language often used by anti-abortion groups. Due to recent events of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v Wade, I strongly believe this project is now more relevant than ever."

The box is 7”x5”x3” and contains a community information book, a pamphlet on the garden, and a seed pack. The box is a container for its contents but can also be repurposed as a planter for the seeds in the box. The papers inside the box are handmade from locally grown plants. Together, the box and its contents reflect the values of sustainability and mutuality rooted in a relationship to land."

    "workDescription": "I took a course at Brown University called Buddhism and Death which explored how the varieties of Buddhist religion represent and understand dying, death, and the afterlife.  In our society, I feel that getting old, dying, and “the end” are often scary, taboo topics. From Christianity, I appropriated the concept of the Last Judgement, the judgment of humankind by God at the end of the world, and the image of Jesus to design a humorous event flyer to make the topic of death and dying less frightening. Given the preoccupation with death and dying brought about by the pandemic, I chose to share my silly and colorful “event” with the public, by posting my event flyers throughout the city of Providence, in order to bring some humor to a difficult moment."

We attempted to make the viewer follow through with these in an instructional manner and write the name of a person, place, animal, or thing they lost. In the end, we burned this book in front of their eyes to watch a part of them disappear. For the purpose of this book, we created 2 versions of the same book for documenting purposes."

    "workDescription": "This collage poster is inspired by staircases from the RISD Design Center building.\nThe staircases in the building are arranged in a zig-zag pattern, creating a sense of disorientation and mystery as you move from one level to the next. The red maze-like routes add to this feeling, creating a sense of being lost in a labyrinth. As I walk through this space, I'm reminded of the Magisches Theater from Hermann Hesse's Der Steppenwolf.\n\nIn Hesse's novel, the Magic Theater is a metaphorical space that the protagonist, Harry Haller (also known as the Steppenwolf), is invited to visit. The theater is made up of an endless number of boxes, each containing a \"pretty cabinet of pictures\" that represents a different aspect of human experience. In order to enter the theater and participate in the show, the Steppenwolf must leave his \"valuable personality\" behind and become a different version of himself.\n\nThe Magic Theater can be seen as an experiment in self-discovery, a form of entertainment, or both. It's a departure from the mundane reality of everyday life, a place where the boundaries between self and other, inner and outer, are blurred. In many ways, the building with its zig-zag staircases and maze-like routes is reminiscent of this magical space, inviting us to leave behind our preconceptions and enter into a world of infinite possibility."

The gathered materials were then used to inform a theme and then the cre- ation of an “artifact” that would then be made public. I had just returned to school from a year’s hiatus when I fulfilled my military service in Finland. So understandably my experiences in Finland’s National Defence Force were still ripe in my mind when I began this project. This work served as an ex- ploration of the thoughts and feelings I had while serving while simultaneously being a bit of a pessimistic take on the predatory recruitment practices of the US Military."

The blue-green color of the paper references the famous blue tint of the first Twilight movie (directed by Catherine Hardwicke, 2008).\n\nThe body of the essay is set in Roslindale by David Jonathan Ross, and the title, headers, and folios are set in Trickster by Jean-Baptiste Morizot. The illuminations are made from characters from Trickster as well."

Drawing upon print’s inherent qualities, this stack of papers should serve as your playground. Dog ear your favorite pages, rip out the ones you can’t stand. Glue in things left out and scribble out the things that should have been. Take your lecture notes on the back. Jot down your grocery list on the front.

During the poster design process, I attempted to replicate the sense of space in my photos by using simple graphics, colors, and text to create a 2D representation. As the course was named 'Reframing the Poster,' I titled my posters 'Reframing the Space with Colors and Shapes' and used the word 'REFRAME' in the posters. The poster with a yellow arrow in the middle was slightly different from the other two posters. It had a blurry edge on the arrow and a noisy background. This difference broke the sense of the Bauhaus aesthetic brought by the pure colors and abstract shapes but kept the consistency of the style of the whole series."

In the track, the music features lo-fi ballad sounds with a mix of R&B. Inspired by Sanctuary's music video, this dynamic typographic poster that offers the viewer a euphoric and explosive experience as if they were in space."

    "workDescription": "A generative mark making tool kit that captures various forms and textures found in nature. Materials such as tree barks, dirt, fiber were sourced to produce a collection of forms to deter from the idea that visual language in design should be “clean and vectorized”. Inspired by the concept of “weathering”, the kit enforces a stronger connection between the user and the natural world – observing the process of repeated pressure or friction applied to a surface. Over time, the object shifts in appearance and new marks or dents are formed.\n\nThe stamps allow for the generation of multiple, endless forms and open-ended systems. They can be edited, changed, arranged, rearranged, and improvised by the user. The kit encourages users to work freely and mindlessly, embracing an intuitive way of working that focuses on the act of making.\n\nThe tool kit consists of: 32 wooden stamps, a sample book that opens up to a poster showcasing marks that each stamp makes, and 3 stencils made from Scoby. Scoby, a Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast, is a natural material and fermentation culture. It is commonly used to prepare sour foods and beverages such as kombucha. When cleaned and dried, it becomes a durable and reusable material that is thin and leathery to the touch."

I created animated versions of posters, banners and stage introductions using Adobe After Effects, all themed appropriately with the official TED brand colors. I decided to experiment with animated variable fonts, with the large ‘X’ forming the standout feature in all design materials. The original Helvetica typeface was updated with Helvetica Now, which was also used for topic and speaker headlines. I also created animated icons for different topics, and used them as graphic elements throughout the posters and banners."

Through my art, I hope to capture and convey the sense of quiet intimacy that can be found in even the most public spaces."

For example, someone might choose bold, bright-colored shutters to reflect their energetic and outgoing personality, while another might opt for more neutral or understated shutters to reflect their reserved and conservative approach to life.Shutters can be a symbol of our relationship with the world around us. For some, closing the shutters represents a desire for privacy, isolation, or protection from the outside world. It can be a way to shut out noise, distractions, or even other people. However, for others, opening the shutters can symbolize a desire for connection, light, and warmth. It can be a way to embrace the beauty of nature, welcome guests into our homes, or simply enjoy the view outside.\n\nThe choice of shutters, like any other decorative element, can be a reflection of one's personal style, taste, and values."
